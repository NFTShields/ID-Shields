# ID-Shields
ID Shields repository

Welcome to the ID Shields webpage!

If you're here is because you're interested in buying some of the ID Shields that we are promoting on Opensea. Congrats! You've made a good decision :-)

ID Shields are designed to represent your unique identity within the Metaverse, although you can use it elsewhere as well. Each ID Shield is unique and can only be associated with one user or owner.

Each ID shield consists of 4 quadrants in which different characteristics that define your identity, your personality and your way of thinking are represented. The 4 quadrants and their meanings are as follows:

# ANIMAL


# PERSONALITY


# ZODIAC SIGN


# ELEMENT
